# Introduction

This is an ongoing project to capture the layout of the industries that comprise cybersecurity, privacy, and risk.

The mapping project is a combination of visuals, definitions, and examples from each area of the ecosystem. Seeing the ecosystem from multiple views is the most practical approach to grappling with the enormity of it all.

You can view the full mapping on the [Strategy of Security website](https://strategyofsecurity.com/cybersecurity-ecosystem/).

For more background on the thought process behind the project, check out the [introductory article](https://strategyofsecurity.com/mapping-the-cybersecurity-ecosystem/).

This repo contains the Markdown under version control. For now, this includes the written portion of the mapping with category definitions and example companies. Any changes I make to the mapping will show up in the repo and get updated on the Strategy of Security site.

You're welcome to submit pull requests if you have changes you'd like to review and incorporate. I reserve the right to decide which ones I incorporate, but I'm definitely open to input that improves the quality of the project.

I have also [created a survey](https://a.sprig.com/WWw0dVR3cFI3Un5zaWQ6OThkNGQ5ZjUtMmMyMC00NDI1LWFiYzMtNGMxZmMwNGFkMmEw) to collect feedback about how you're using the visual and data (or how you'd like to use it).

I hope you find this useful as you build your understanding of cybersecurity and plot your course in the industry.
